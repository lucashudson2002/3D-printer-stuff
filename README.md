# Oppenheimer - Marlin

My Marlin settings on my 3D printer I built from scratch, which I called Oppenheimer, and the list of materials I used to build it.

Forked from [Marlin's repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin);

Based on the Creality Ender 3, my first printer, which I modified and called [Barbie](https://github.com/lucashudson2002/3D-printer-stuff/tree/barbie).
